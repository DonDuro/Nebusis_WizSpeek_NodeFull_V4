# WizSpeek¬Æ V4.0.3 - Frontend & UI Updates

## Overview
This package contains all frontend/UI changes since V3.0.0 that do NOT impact Render backend deployment functionality.

## Files Included (7 files)

### üé® Frontend Components
- **`client/src/components/auth-modal.tsx`** - Fixed demo login credentials and added helpful credential display guidance
- **`client/src/components/settings-modal.tsx`** - Enhanced settings functionality with working buttons across all 8 tabs

- **`client/src/pages/reset-password.tsx`** - NEW: Professional password reset page with token validation

### üìß Email Service (New Feature)

### üñºÔ∏è Professional Assets
- **`attached_assets/Celso Professional_1752971797358.jpg`** - Professional avatar for admin user Calvarado

### üìù Documentation
- **`replit.md`** - Updated project documentation with V4.0.3 changelog and all enhancements since V3.0.0

## Why These Files Are NOT Render-Relevant

1. **Frontend Components**: Only affect user interface, not backend deployment
2. **UI Enhancements**: Settings modal improvements are client-side only
3. **Static Assets**: Professional photos don't impact server functionality
4. **Documentation**: Project documentation doesn't affect deployment
5. **Email Service**: While new, doesn't require Render environment changes (uses console/SMTP)
6. **Password Reset Page**: New frontend route, no backend deployment impact

## Installation Instructions

### For Frontend-Only Deployments
1. Replace these client-side files in your static deployment
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add professional assets to your asset pipeline

### For Full-Stack Deployments  
1. These files enhance user experience but don't require Render restarts
2. Email service works with existing environment (console mode for dev, SMTP for production)
3. Static assets can be deployed to CDN or asset pipeline
